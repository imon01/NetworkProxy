just build the network connections abstractions and then use one listening connectiont to 
	generate a thread that accepts/rejects connections


accept connection:
	if in A_table

reject connection:
	close the file descripter given on accept() call

remarks:
	ffor the listening thread, look into SIGIO for the thread containing the 
	listening socket to deliver a SIGNAL for incoming connections
