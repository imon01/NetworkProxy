connections:
	-c connect
	-l listen

	-a address (required for -c)
	-p port   (optional)
	
		-->allow only unreserved ports

	eg:
		./exec -c -a "190.90.90.91" -p

NFA design:

	S(connect) -> S1, set up connection
	S1(address)  -> S3, grab address
	S3(e| port)  -> S, grab port if provided
	S(accept ) -> S2, listen for address, accept from address
	S2(addre)  -> S4, grab address, 
	S4(port | e) -> S, grab port if provided
